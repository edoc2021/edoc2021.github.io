The IEEE EDOC 2020 Demonstration Track offers an exciting and highly interactive way to present prototypes and applications in the context of enterprise computing. Prototypes and applications may originate either from research projects or from industry. Proposals for demonstrations should focus on innovative concepts or technologies that address models, methodologies, and engineering technologies contributing to intra- and inter-enterprise application systems. Authors of accepted conference papers are also invited to propose demonstrations of their work.

Topics of Interest
Areas of interest for demonstrations include all topics of the IEEE EDOC conference. Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:

Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Enterprise Service Architecture (ESA)
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Business Process Management (BPM) and Business Rules
Process Mining
Business Intelligence and Business Analytics
Big Data & Data Mining
Information Integration and Interoperability
Model-based Approaches
Enterprise Applications Deployment and Governance
Security Solutions for Enterprises
Submission Guidelines
Demonstration paper submissions are invited for potential inclusion in the demonstration track. All submissions must be made in PDF format and comply with the IEEE Computer Society Conference Proceedings Format Guidelines (https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Demonstration papers should address the aforementioned topics in no more than 4 pages, which should include the following information:

Title and authors
Abstract: A brief description of the prototype or application, together with a statement on how conference participants benefit from attending the demonstration
System overview
Summary of innovative concepts and significance for the EDOC domain as well as functions or features to be demonstrated. If applicable, include brief descriptions of case studies performed using the prototype or application, provide scalability data or pointers indicating where readers can find more information about these case studies.
Link (optional): A link to a Web page where to download or use the tool.
Additionally, authors may provide a link to a short online video or screencast not exceeding 6 minutes in length (hard limit) of their demonstration. The video is recommended, not mandatory. The video must be playable using a wide variety of media players.

Submission Guidelines and Review Process
Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format via the EDOC Conference Management system hosted on EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edoc2020

The demonstration chairs and demo committee will review all submissions. Accepted demonstration papers are published in the workshop proceedings of the IEEE EDOC conference, which will be submitted to the IEEE Xplore® digital library. At least one presenter of each accepted demonstration must register for the conference and be in attendance to present the demonstration.

A best demo award will be given to the author(s) of the highest-scoring demo based on technical merit.
