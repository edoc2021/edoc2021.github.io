**EDOC 2021** is the twenty-fifth in a series of conferences launched on the Gold Coast, Australia, to provide the key forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of enterprise computing. EDOC conferences address the full range of models, methodologies, and engineering technologies contributing to intra- and inter-enterprise application systems. Since 1997, EDOC has brought together leading computer scientists, IT decision makers, enterprise architects, solution designers, and practitioners to discuss enterprise computing challenges, models and solutions from the perspectives of academia, industry, and government. The EDOC conference series emphasizes a holistic view on enterprise applications engineering and management, fostering integrated approaches that address and relate business models, business processes, business policies, people and technology.

The theme of EDOC2021 is on considering enterprise computing challenges in the context of new technologies related to the fourth industrial revolution and beyond, including AI, data science, distributed ledgers/blockchain, IoT, genomics and augmented reality. The aim is to start addressing new business challenges in the domains such as healthcare, advanced manufacturing, environmental sciences, sustainable agriculture and FinTech, while ensuring compliance with the related human rights, ethics and legal challenges.

We are preparing for EDOC21 to be held physically and to host both national and international audience. We will be also considering a **hybrid option, as it may reflect COVID19 developments**, such as national face to face attendees and virtual international participation. We will be monitoring the COVID19 situation and will update this website accordingly.
