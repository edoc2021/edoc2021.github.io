<h3>Coronavirus Update</h3>
<p>Due to the uncertainty of the extent to which travel and meetings in large groups will be possible in October and in line with decisions made by other scientific conferences, we decided to move EDOC 2020 online. We will make the presentations as accessible as possible. Please find more information on the registration page.</p>

**IEEE EDOC 2020** is the twenty-fourth conference in a series that provides the key forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of enterprise computing. EDOC conferences address the full range of models, methodologies, and engineering technologies contributing to intra- and inter-enterprise application systems. Since 1997, EDOC has brought together leading computer scientists, IT decision makers, enterprise architects, solution designers, and practitioners to discuss enterprise computing challenges, models and solutions from the perspectives of academia, industry, and government. The EDOC conference series emphasizes a holistic view on enterprise applications engineering and management, fostering integrated approaches that address and relate business models, business processes, people and technology.
