IEEE EDOC 2020 is the twenty-fourth conference in a series that provides the key forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of enterprise computing. EDOC conferences address the full range of models, methodologies, and engineering technologies contributing to intra- and inter-enterprise software application systems. Since 1997, EDOC has brought together leading computer scientists, software engineers, IT decision makers, enterprise architects, solution designers, and practitioners to discuss enterprise computing challenges, models and solutions from the perspectives of academia, industry, and government. The IEEE EDOC conference series emphasizes a holistic view on enterprise applications engineering and management, fostering integrated approaches that address and relate business processes, people, software, and technology. EDOCâ€™20 welcomes high quality scientific submissions as well as experience papers on enterprise computing from industry. Expert panel discussions and keynotes will address current topics and issues in this domain.

- Master data management, data mining and (real-time) data warehousing
- Complex event processing and event-driven architectures
- Data quality and trustworthiness

Submission Guidelines
Two types of paper submissions are solicited: a) scientific research papers, and b) industry experience reports or case studies.

Scientific research papers should describe original results not been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. These papers will be evaluated based on their scientific and technical contribution, originality, and relevance.

In turn, industry experience reports should provide new insights gained in case studies or when applying enterprise computing technology in practice; industry experience reports shall further provide important feedback about the state of practice and pose challenges for researchers. These papers will be evaluated based on their appropriateness, significance, and clarity. Industry experience reports must report an actual implementation in practice and must have at least one author with an industry affiliation.

Submissions should be full papers with 8-10 pages. All submissions must be made in PDF format and comply with the IEEE Computer Society Conference Proceedings Format Guidelines

They should be made via the electronic submission system of the EDOC Conference Management system hosted on EasyChair: <a style="color: black;text-decoration: underline;" href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edoc2020"><i>https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edoc2020 </i></a>

All papers will be refereed by at least 3 members of the international program committee. The conference proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press and be made accessible through IEEE Xplore and the IEEE Computer Society Digital Library.

Each accepted paper must have one of its authors registered to the conference before the camera ready deadline. The conference organizers reserve the right of removing a paper from the proceedings if no author is officially registered by the camera ready deadline. Moreover, only papers that have been presented by their authors during the conference will be published in IEEE Proceedings.

Post Conference Publication
The authors of a collection of selected papers will be invited to prepare a substantially revised and extended version to a Special Issue on Enterprise Computing in the Elsevier journal Information Systems.
