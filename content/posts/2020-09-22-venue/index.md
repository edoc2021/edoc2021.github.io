EDOC 2020 will take place in online. However, it was originally scheduled to be held in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. In case you want to visit Eindhoven at another time, we would be happy to welcome you in Eindhoven and on the campus of Eindhoven University of Technology.

Though Eindhoven is already officially recognised as a city since 1232, it only really started growing when the brothers Philips founded a light bulb factory there. Now, it is the fifth largest city in the Netherlands and the major hub of high-tech research and development in Europe. The big high-tech companies and the university brought a very international crowd to the city, thus creating a very hospitable environment for international guests.
