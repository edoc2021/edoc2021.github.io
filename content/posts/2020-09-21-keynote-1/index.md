In this presentation, Marc Lankhorst, who has led the team that developed the ArchiMate language since the first ideas in 2002, will discuss the history and evolution of the ArchiMate modeling language for enterprise architecture. It started out in 2002 as an applied R&D project in the Netherlands, with partners from both industry and academia. Since 2009 it is an Open Group standard, now in version 3.1. Over the years, ArchiMate has evolved into the leading enterprise architecture modeling method, with many thousands of users. In his presentation, Marc will discuss the key principles behind the design of the language that have been upheld over the course of its evolution. He will explain how the language structure was inspired by natural language, and how it evolved to cover all aspects that an enterprise architecture typically covers. Finally, he will offer his personal thoughts on possible future directions for its further development. Marc will finish his presentation with an interactive Q&A session.
